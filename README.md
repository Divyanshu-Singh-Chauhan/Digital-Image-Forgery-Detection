# Image-Forgery-Detection

Models for Digital Image Forgery Detection

This contains all the models built using Deep Learning approaches

DL_Simple1 - For Detection of forgery only - Needs a lot of improvement.

UNET - For Localisation of forgery using ELA and its masks as the dataset.
1. UNET

Data_Preprocessing - Contains the code for prerprocessing of the dataset for the UNET model.

GANs Based Autoencoder :-
This contains the GANs aided Autoencoder model built to detect forgery in images using self-supervised learning approach.
