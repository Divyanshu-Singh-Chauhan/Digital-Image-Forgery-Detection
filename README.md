# Image-Forgery-Detection

Models for Digital Image Forgery Detection

ELA_And_LOW_PASS_FILTER : Contains the code for performing Error Level Analysis on the original image and also the code for Low Pass Filter.

PCA_based_detection : This method is used for copy-move forgery detection. 
Reference for the above approach from  : **Exposing Digital Forgeries by Detecting Duplicated Image Regions**

Feature Based Extraction Approach : Contains the code with an extended version of the PCA based approach. ( Approach is similar to PCA_based_detection with a different feature extraction method )

The "master" branch contains Non-DL approaches and "DL" branch contains DL approaches
